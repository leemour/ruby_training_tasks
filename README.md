The game is played in turns.   
Each turn a player hits the monster and the the monster hits the player.  
The game ends when either monster's or players health is <= 0.

Monster hits the player for a random value between 1 and 6.  
Each turn at the beginning of the turn player can choose to do normal attack or special attack (2x normal damage).

The player chooses who goes (hits) first: monster or player.  
Each turn the damage of each hit and resuming health are logged into the console like this:  
"Player hits monster for 4 damage. Monster has 12 health left"  
When game ends, the result is printed to the console.
