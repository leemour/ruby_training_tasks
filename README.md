## Monster Fight

Create CLI game where a player fights the monster.  
The game is played in turns.   
Each turn a player hits the monster and the the monster hits the player.  
The game ends when either monster's or players health is <= 0.   
Player starts with 30 health and monster starts with 25 health.  
Player hits the monster for a random value between 2 and 5.  
Monster hits the player for a random value between 1 and 6.  
Each turn at the beginning of the turn player can choose to do normal attack or special attack (2x normal damage).  
Player has only 1 special attack.  
When a program is launched a new game is started.  
The player chooses who goes (hits) first: monster or player.  
Each turn the damage of each hit and resuming health are printed to the console like this:  
"Player hits monster for 4 damage. Monster has 12 health left"  
When game ends, the result is printed to the console.  
When game ends the player can choose to start the game again.  
The player can exit the game any time by writing "quit".  

Use OOP approaches you've learned to implement this functionality. Try to reuse as much code as possible.
